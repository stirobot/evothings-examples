# Improved Examples for Evothings Studio

**added by me**

I really liked the evothings example code that made gps data on the linkit one into jsonp.  I though the example was pretty straightforward and I wanted to add some things to it (expose some of the other data from GPS in the json.  So, I forked their code to retain all the linkback to them, attribution, documenation, and proper Apache license statements.

The only folder I've modified or added things to is the one regarding mediatek examples.

**below is the original readme**

Apps in folder 'examples' are included in the Evothings Studio download.

Apps in folder 'experiments' are under development and are not guaranteed to work.

Note that CSS and library files shared across apps are in folder 'resources'. The Ruby script 'build.rb' copies the relevant files to the example folders. The example apps won't work unless you first run this script. The examples included with Evothings Studio are already pre-built.

To remove files copied by 'build.rb', run 'git clean -fdX'.
